Feature: Upload csv data to database, read data from db and validate

  Scenario: Validate row count and columns match with the test data
    Given I have a spark session
    And a <csv_file> for the equivalent <table>
    And I upload the csv data into database
    When I select all the data from the table
    Then the table result should match with csv data
    Examples:
    | csv_file | table |
    |  person   |  person  |
